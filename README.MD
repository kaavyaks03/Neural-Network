# Stroke Attack Prediction 


### *A Beginner Level Project in Machine Learning!*

## Objective
Stroke Attack Prediction is a basic project engaging Artificial Neural Network to predict the percetage of stroke attack for commoners on the basis of their vital signs and necessary informations. This project is developed to explore working with neural network in Machine Learning. This prediction model consists of one input layer, two hidden layers and one output layer in it. Thus the project helps in predicting the risk of stroke for the people.This also results in letting out the confusion matrix of the test and train datasets to know about Accuracy, Predicion and Recall rates.
